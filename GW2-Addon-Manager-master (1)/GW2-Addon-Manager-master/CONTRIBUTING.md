# Contributing
General guidelines for how to contribute to the project.

### Adding a compatible addon

### Pull Requests
Changes to be merged should be related to the PR description and title. Documentation and comments for changes are appreciated, but if the code is readable without them it's fine to leave them out.

### Issues
Opening an issue: Select the appropriate template and fill in the applicable fields according to their descriptions.
